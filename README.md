# GBM-analysis
Code from the Costa Lab modified in order to analyze genomic characteristics of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. (https://www.costalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R_class_D3.html#2_TCGA_data)
I investigated which gene mutations are prevalent in GBM, based on machine learning, and what the breakdown of patients who have GBM is (gender, race, etc).
Using a machine learning method called the Elastic Net Model, I generated a predicted list of genes involved in GBM.
